# Off Work — Leave Management System (SaaS)

**Off Work** is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that lets companies create an account and manage their employees' holidays and leave requests. Each company signs up as its own organization (tenant) and manages its own employees, departments, holiday policies, and leave requests, fully isolated from other tenants.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-tenant architecture** — every company operates as an isolated organization, with its own employees, departments, and settings.
- **Leave request management** — employees can submit, view, and cancel leave requests; managers and HR can review and act on their team's requests.
- **Personal & team calendars** — a personal calendar (`/me/calendar`) and a team-wide calendar (`/team/calendar`) for visualizing time off.
- **Departments** — organize employees into departments, with managers assigned per team.
- **Closure days & bank holidays** — configure company closure days and import UK bank holidays (England & Wales / Scotland / Northern Ireland), shown alongside company-wide closures.
- **Team dashboard** — an overview for managers/HR of team availability and pending requests.
- **Role-based access control** — different permission levels across the organization (see below).
- **Email notifications** — password reset, email verification, and other transactional emails via Resend.

## 👥 Roles & Permissions

The platform is designed around the following roles:

| Role | Scope |
|---|---|
| **System Admin** | Platform-level administration across all tenant organizations |
| **Owner** | Full control over a single company's account, billing, and settings |
| **HR** | Manages employees, departments, and leave policies across the organization |
| **Manager** | Manages their own team's employees and leave requests |
| **Employee** | Submits and tracks their own leave requests |

> **Current implementation status:** the data model currently supports the `Manager` and `Employee` roles end-to-end (route groups `(app)/me` for employees and `(app)/team` for managers/HR-level views). Support for the `Owner`, `HR`, and `System Admin` roles is on the roadmap as the permission model is extended.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 16 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) (core, dates, charts, forms, notifications)
- **Database:** MongoDB with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- **Authentication:** [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) (email/password, email verification, `organization` and `admin` plugins for multi-tenancy)
- **Email:** [Resend](https://resend.com/) + [React Email](https://react.email/)
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **Linting/formatting:** [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Multi-tenancy** is handled through Better Auth's `organization` plugin, which is the source of truth for tenants (organizations, members, invitations). The `Employee` collection acts as an HR profile linked 1:1 to a Better Auth user via `userId`, and is scoped to a tenant via `organizationId`.
- **Two-layer security model:**
  1. `middleware.ts` performs a fast, edge-level cookie-presence check before a request reaches a protected route.
  2. `auth.api.getSession()` is called inside layout files for full cryptographic session/role verification server-side.
- **Route groups:**
  - `(app)/me` — the employee-facing area (personal calendar, personal leave requests).
  - `(app)/team` — the manager/HR-facing area (team dashboard, team calendar, employees, departments, leave requests, settings).
  - `(marketing)` — the public-facing marketing site.
